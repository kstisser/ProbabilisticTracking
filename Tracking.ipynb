    "First, to be able to run the tutorial, the following was done to create a runnable environment:\n",
    "1. Create an environment using anaconda\n",
    "2. Open a terminal using this environment\n",
    "3. Install pytorch by running in the terminal _conda installpytorch torchvision -c pytorch_\n",

    "Two things were added to the code base to be able to make it run out of a terminal:\n",
    "1. The following code was added due to this [stack overflow error recommendation](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/20554074/sklearn-omp-error-15-when-fitting-models):\n",
